## 🛡️ About Me

I’m a cybersecurity student specializing in Offensive Security, currently in my third year at the University of Information Technology (UIT). I’m passionate about Red Teaming, Penetration Testing, and Ethical Hacking.

I continuously sharpen my skills through CTF competitions, hands-on labs, building my own security tools/scripts and projects.

My goal is to join a professional Red Team where I can push my skills further, contribute to real-world attack simulations, and help organizations strengthen their security posture.

I’m always open to connecting with like-minded security professionals, CTF teams, and mentors. Feel free to reach out — let’s make this world a safer place together.
